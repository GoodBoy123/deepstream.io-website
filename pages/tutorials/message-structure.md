Message Structure
========================================
Deepstream messages are transmitted using a proprietary, minimal, string-based protocol. Every message follows the same structure:

<div class="message-structure">
&lt;topic&gt;|&lt;action&gt;|&lt;data[0]&gt;|...|&lt;data[n]&gt;+
</div>

| and + are used in these examples as placeholders, messages are actually separated by invisible Ascii control characters ("record separator" (30) and "group seperator" (31))

Every message has a topic (e.g. RECORD, EVENT, AUTH etc.) and an action ( CREATE, DELETE, SUBSCRIBE etc.). For a full list of available topics and actions please see [docs/constants.html](../docs/constants.html).


### Example
Here's an example: creating or reading a record `Lisa`

	userLisa = ds.record.getRecord( 'Lisa' );

would prompt the client to send this message to the server

Messages always start with `topic` and `action`, but can contain an arbitrary amount of data fields afterwards. 

Setting the value of a path within the record for example

	userLisa.set( 'lastname', 'Owen' );

would result in this outgoing message

Please note the additional S before `Owen`. This indicates that the remaining part of the message should be treated as a string. Please find a list of (available types here)[../docs/constants.html#Data Types]

Both client and server use a message-parser to validate these messages and to convert them into objects looking like this:

	{
		raw: 'R\u001fP\u001fLisa\u001f1\u001flastname\u001fSOwen',
		topic: 'R',
		action: 'P',
		data: [ 'Lisa', '1', 'lastname', 'SOwen' ]
	}
